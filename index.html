            <h2 id="Discography">Taylor Swift's Discography</h2>
            <p>Taylor Swift's first two albums "Taylor Swift" (2006) and "Fearless" (2008) were classified in the genre of country music.  "Tim McGraw," "Love Story," and "You Belong With Me" were some of her earliest recognizable works that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100.  Since her origins as a country singer, Swift has experimented with different sounds and genres, building her discography to what it is today.  Her album "Speak Now" (2010) distinguished a shift from country to "country-pop," with top ranked songs "Mine" and "Mean."  Her 2012 album "Red" deputed number 1 in the U.S., producing break-up anthems such as  "We Are Never Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble."  "Red" would be Swift's final album produced under the "country-pop" genre, pulling inspiration from the 1980s' synth music style. </p>
            <p>"1989," the album named after the year Swift was born, released in 2014.  The most popular songs from "1989" include "Shake It Off," "Blank Space," and "Bad Blood."  At the 2016 Grammy Awards, "1989" won in 3 categories and was deemed "Album of the Year."  Considered one of her most influential albums, "1989" marked Swift's official switch into the pop genre.</p>
            <p>After a year-long hiatus from making music and being present on social media, Swift released the "Reputation" album in 2017.  The album's top songs include "Look What You Made Me Do" and "...Ready For It?" and it incorporated elements of the electropop music style.  Swift's 2019 album "Lover" was Swift's first album she officially owned rather than her record label.  Top songs from "Lover" include "You Need To Calm Down" and "Cruel Summer," which incorporate similar synth and electropop sounds from earlier albums.  Every song off the album charted on the Billboard top 100 within the same week.</p>
            <p>A year after the release of "Lover," Swift began re-recording her older albums as a result of an ongoing dispute between her and Big Machine Records over ownership of her earlier work.  Swift's "Folklore" and "Evermore" were both released in 2020 as sister albums, debuting just 5 months apart.  Both albums displayed a different style than Swift's previous pop albums, possessing alternative and indie style elements.  "Midnights" (2022) reached the number 1 spot on Billboard top charts globally.  With top songs "Anti-Hero" and "Karma," the album harnessed a similar pop sound to her albums releaseed prior to 2020.  "Midnights" is the most recent original album to be released in Swift's discography. </p>
            <p>Since 2021, Taylor Swift has released re-recorded albums "Fearless," "Red," "Speak Now," and is currently working on the re-recording of "1989" to be released in October 2023.</p>

            <h2 id="Why">Why I like Taylor Swift</h2>
            <p>Reasons Taylor Swift is my favorite artist:</p>
            <ul class="reason-list">
                <li>I enjoy the lyricism in her songs, especially those from the "Folklore" and "Reputation" albums.  I find that many people generalize Taylor Swift's music as "mass-produced" pop, but a lot of my favorite songs of hers offer insight on societal issues and processing deep emotions.</li>
                <li>Many of Taylor Swift's songs are just catchy and fun to dance to.</li>
                <li>The way that I have seen Taylor Swift speak up about feminism in recent years resonates with me, especially following the release of "The Man" off her "Lover" album.</li>
                <li>While I have not been to her concert, my brother (who has gone) claims she is an excellent performer.</li>
                <li>I have been listening to Taylor Swift since I was in elementary school.  Listening to her music for such a long time means her songs have the ability to make me feel nostalgic.  I feel like Taylor Swift's music followed alongside me growing up.</li>
